    Error Log Parser

        Extracts meaningful information from installer error logs.
        Identifies missing files, corrupt files, or dependency errors.

    File Verifier

        Checks integrity via hash verification (e.g., SHA-256).
        Scans the installer folder for missing/corrupted files.

    Dependency Checker

        Detects if necessary dependencies (DirectX, Visual C++, .NET Framework) are installed.
        Suggests or automates installation.

    Web Search Module

        Scrapes or searches for required files online.
        Fetches download links for missing or corrupt files.

    File Repair Module

        Downloads missing/corrupted files.
        Places them in the correct directory.

    Retry Logic

        Restarts or resumes installation after applying fixes.

    User Interface (CLI for MVP)

        Command-line interface for user interaction.
        Displays errors, status updates, and suggestions.
